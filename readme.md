# SVGeezy
### A JavaScript plugin to handle your images in browsers that don't support SVGs

SVGeezy is in essence, a fallback plugin. It allows you to use SVGs for all your assets, giving you complete resolution independence.

It checks if the browser supports SVGs, if not, changes the _src_ of the image to a _.png_ instead (or whatever you pass in).

### Installing SVGeezy

SVGeezy can being installed using bower with `bower install svgeezy`. Alternatively, you can download or clone this repo manually.

### Use

	svgeezy.init('nocheck', 'png'); // this will tell the plugin to not check images with a class of 'nocheck'

or 

	svgeezy.init(false, 'png');	// this will let the plugin check all images
	
The first parameter is a class to tell the code not to check. Feel free to pass in `false` if you want SVGeezy to check all images. This may be because you have no fallbacks for certain SVGs. 

The second is a filetype, this can be anything you want, just make sure the file path resolves to an image. ie. _'/images/logo.svg'_, will be replaced with _'/images/logo.png'_.
